Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving frequently used data to shared memory."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 0.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving frequently used data to shared memory."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 0.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 52.6% of the total average of 13.8 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving frequently used data to shared memory."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 1.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 1 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 32.1% of the total average of 12.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

This represents about 52.8% of the total average of 13.8 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving frequently used data to shared memory."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 1.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 52.4% of the total average of 13.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving frequently used data to shared memory."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 1.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 52.7% of the total average of 13.8 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving frequently used data to shared memory."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 1.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 44.5% of the total average of 36.0 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 46.0% of the total average of 33.3 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 52.0% of the total average of 32.2 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 60.1% of the total average of 31.0 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 65.5% of the total average of 28.8 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 40.8% of the total average of 29.3 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 40.7% of the total average of 26.5 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 44.6% of the total average of 25.5 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 51.4% of the total average of 24.2 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 55.2% of the total average of 23.0 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 54.5% of the total average of 24.4 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 45.6% of the total average of 76.5 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of stalls due to draining warps typically occurs when a lot of data is written to memory towards the end of a kernel. Make sure the memory access patterns of these store operations are optimal for the target architecture and consider parallelized data reduction, if applicable."

This represents about 45.4% of the total average of 74.8 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of stalls due to draining warps typically occurs when a lot of data is written to memory towards the end of a kernel. Make sure the memory access patterns of these store operations are optimal for the target architecture and consider parallelized data reduction, if applicable."

This represents about 45.9% of the total average of 75.1 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of stalls due to draining warps typically occurs when a lot of data is written to memory towards the end of a kernel. Make sure the memory access patterns of these store operations are optimal for the target architecture and consider parallelized data reduction, if applicable."

This represents about 45.8% of the total average of 75.0 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of stalls due to draining warps typically occurs when a lot of data is written to memory towards the end of a kernel. Make sure the memory access patterns of these store operations are optimal for the target architecture and consider parallelized data reduction, if applicable."

Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized kernels. If possible, try to further increase the number of active warps to hide the corresponding instruction latencies."

This represents about 52.8% of the total average of 22.2 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 1000 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."
