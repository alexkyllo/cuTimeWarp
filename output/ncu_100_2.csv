Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 25.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 22.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 25.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 22.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 0.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 0.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 26.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 23.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 57.6% of the total average of 10.1 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving frequently used data to shared memory."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 1.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 1 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 26.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 23.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 57.8% of the total average of 10.2 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving frequently used data to shared memory."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 1.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 26.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 23.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving frequently used data to shared memory."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 1.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 26.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 23.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 58.4% of the total average of 10.2 cycles between issuing two instructions. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing data locality or by changing the cache configuration, and consider moving frequently used data to shared memory."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 1.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 1.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 1 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 26 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 21.2%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid."

This represents about 41.8% of the total average of 11.4 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 18.1 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 17.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 100 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 26 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 21.2%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid."

This represents about 42.6% of the total average of 11.0 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 18.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 18.2 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 100 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 26 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 21.2%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid."

This represents about 44.5% of the total average of 11.4 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 18.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 18.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 26 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 21.2%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid."

This represents about 49.3% of the total average of 12.3 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 17.8 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 17.2 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 60.7% of the total average of 21.3 cycles between issuing two instructions. A read from constant memory costs one memory read from global memory only on a cache miss; otherwise, it just costs one read from the constant cache. Immediate constants are encoded into the SASS instruction as 'c[bank][offset]'. All threads access the same value."

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 26 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 21.2%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid."

This represents about 57.8% of the total average of 14.2 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 15.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 15.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 37.8% of the total average of 10.7 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 20.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 19.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 38.5% of the total average of 10.0 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 21.2 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 20.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 41.0% of the total average of 10.3 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 21.2 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 20.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 45.7% of the total average of 10.8 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 21.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 19.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 53.0% of the total average of 11.7 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 20.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 19.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 45.7% of the total average of 10.8 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 21.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 19.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 49.2% of the total average of 13.2 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 20.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 19.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 35.9% of the total average of 5.6 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized kernels. If possible, try to further increase the number of active warps to hide the corresponding instruction latencies."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 35.9% of the total average of 5.6 cycles between issuing two instructions.

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.8 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.1 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 6.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.8 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.1 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 6.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.8 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.1 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 6.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.8 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.1 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 6.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.2 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.7 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.2 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.7 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 31.9% of the total average of 6.0 cycles between issuing two instructions.

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.2 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.7 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 32.1% of the total average of 6.0 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized kernels. If possible, try to further increase the number of active warps to hide the corresponding instruction latencies."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.2 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.9 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 7.7 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.5 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.2 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.1 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.5 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.2 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 30.2% of the total average of 6.5 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized kernels. If possible, try to further increase the number of active warps to hide the corresponding instruction latencies."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.1 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.5 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.2 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.1 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.5 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.2 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.1 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 7.8 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This represents about 30.8% of the total average of 6.1 cycles between issuing two instructions.

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.3 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.0 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 9.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 9.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 9.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 9.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 9.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 9.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 9.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 9.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 9.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 9.0 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.7 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This represents about 30.3% of the total average of 6.2 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized kernels. If possible, try to further increase the number of active warps to hide the corresponding instruction latencies."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.4 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.1 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.7 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.4 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.8 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.5 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.6 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.3 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

Optimal instruction throughput is achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 8.9 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced to 8.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch. Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible. In addition, ensure your kernel makes use of Independent Thread Scheduling, which allows a warp to reconverge after a data-dependent conditional block by explicitly calling __syncwarp()."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 16 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."

This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources."
