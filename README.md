# cuTimeWarp

CUDA Implementations of Dynamic Time Warping and SoftDTW loss function
for time series machine learning.

Based on algorithms described in:

- ["Soft-DTW: A Differentiable Loss Function for Time Series"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01541.pdf)
- ["Developing a pattern discovery method in time series data and its GPU acceleration"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8400444)
