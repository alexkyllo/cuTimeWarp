  abstract     = {We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series, building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping ({DTW}) discrepancy. Unlike the Euclidean distance, {DTW} can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute {DTW}, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of {DTW}, called soft-{DTW}, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-{DTW} is a differentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity ({DTW} has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regularization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the {DTW} geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines. Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-{DTW} sense.},

  abstract   = {Nested loops with regular iteration dependencies span a large class of applications ranging from string matching to linear system solvers. Wavefront parallelism is a well-known technique to enable concurrent processing of such applications and is widely being used on {GPUs} to beneﬁt from their massively parallel computing capabilities. Wavefront parallelism on {GPUs} uses global barriers between processing of tiles to enforce data dependencies. However, such diagonal-wide synchronization causes load imbalance by forcing {SMs} to wait for the completion of the {SM} with longest computation. Moreover, diagonal processing causes loss of locality due to elements that border adjacent tiles. In this paper, we propose {PeerWave}, an alternative {GPU} wavefront parallelization technique that improves inter-{SM} load balance by using peer-wise synchronization between {SMs}. and eliminating global synchronization. Our approach also increases {GPU} L2 cache locality through row allocation of tiles to the {SMs}. We further improve {PeerWave} performance by using ﬂexible hyper-tiles that reduce inter-{SM} wait time while maximizing intra-{SM} utilization. We develop an analytical model for determining the optimal tile size. Finally, we present a run-time and a {CUDA} based {API} to allow users to easily implement their applications using {PeerWave}. We evaluate {PeerWave} on the {NVIDIA} K40c {GPU} using 6 diﬀerent applications and achieve speedups of up to 2X compared to the most recent hyperplane transformation based {GPU} implementation.},
